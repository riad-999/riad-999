<h1>PHP Laravle E-commerce Template Website</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
The project consists of a template for an e-commerce website for general purposes with filtering features and an admin panel to manage the store. This was developed using the Laravel PHP framework. I didn't use any other framework aside from Tailwind CSS for styling.This project helped me gain a deeper knowledge of how websites work with the MVC software architecture that Laravel offers, get more used to the SQL language, and get more experience in Javascript and programming and software development overall.
